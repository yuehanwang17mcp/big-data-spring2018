# Problem Set 8: Linking Graphs and Charts

At this point, we've learned to produce maps and charts using `d3.js`... but what if we want maps and graphs to talk to each other? In previous weeks, we've produced a map of 311 calls by neighborhood in the City of Boston; we've also represented this same data using bar charts. Now, let's make a paired graphic that highlights both the neighborhood on a map and its bar on a corresponding stacked bar chart chart that shows the composition of 311 calls by source. In essence, this problem set asks you to take the products of PSet 6 and PSet 7, and link them!

For inspiration, you should look to the `linked-choro` project included in this folder repository, and the completed Boston choropleth map we made in week 10 (`boston-choro`) as well as the stacked bar chart we made in week 9 (`finished-charts`).

## Deliverables

+ One html file, included in the submissions folder, that contains a map and a chart that responds to user mouseovers, highlighting the active neighborhood in both cases.
