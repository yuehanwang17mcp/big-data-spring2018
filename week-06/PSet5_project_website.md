# Front End Environments: HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Problem Set 5

## Instructions

We are giving you more time for this Problem Set, because next week is your midterm presentation and you should focus on that first. Once midterms are set and you have your topic, we want you to create a website for your project.

## Deadlines

+ Website Due on Wednesday, April 4 by 6PM.

## Part 1: Create a Project Website

Create a project homepage on your Github site that you will use to host your project and data visualizations. It is up to you how to structure it. One team member can set up a website in their account for the team and invite others can commit and collaborate.

You should put your midterm presentation on your website as a showcase of what your project will be and do.

On your website:

1. Include your branding in your design
2. Name of your project team and a short summary of your project
3. Include your mid-term presentation

You just need one website per project group.

### Some suggestions

Use a template like [Bootstrap](http://duspviz.mit.edu/web-map-workshop/bootstrap-templates/) in your page customization. Check out this DUSPViz tutorial that will walk you through [how to get started with customizing Bootstrap](http://duspviz.mit.edu/web-map-workshop/bootstrap-templates/). You can find free Bootstrap templates at [http://startbootstrap.com](http://startbootstrap.com/).

Use a template like a [Bootstrap Carousel](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_carousel.asp) to show your slides.

## Part 2: Get Started with D3

Get started with D3 by grabbing an example of your choice from [Bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org/). One of the best ways to get started is to read and implement some of the code available online. Mike Bostock, the creator of D3, has designed a website called [Bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org/) that showcases examples of D3 code saved on Github. Bostock himself has a bunch of examples himself located on [his personal Bl.ocks page](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock).

For Part 3 of the Problem Set, your project team should get a D3 visualization from `Bl.ocks`, copy the respective code into files on your server, and get it running on your website. It can be on a separate page. You don't need to incorporate your own data at this point.

1. Get the code for a visualization you like and might be similar to what you want to use from [Bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org/).
2. Set it up on a page on your website.
