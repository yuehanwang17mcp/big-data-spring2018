# Final Project: Abstract and References

## Deadlines

+ Project Paragraph should be submitted to Stellar by *Monday March 12th at 6PM*.

## Description

In order to help you prepare for your final project, you will be divided into project groups of 3-4. Each group will then write up an abstract covering the topic and question you would like to address for your final project. Please lay out the topic you are interested and the question you would like to answer. Force yourself to be as specific as possible. Remember that the project must be based in Greater Boston and that it should think about the intersection of climate change and housing.

Also, please include at least three journalistic, academic, or data sources that include either directly applicable materials or visualization styles youâ€™d like to work with. Please attach links to these resources with your abstract. Feel free to include more than three!
