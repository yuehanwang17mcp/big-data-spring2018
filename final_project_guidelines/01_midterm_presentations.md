# Final Project: Midterm Presentation

## Deadlines

+ Project Presentations should be submitted to Stellar by *Monday March 19th by 9AM*.
+ Presentations will be given in class on March 19 and March 20.

## Description

Your project should prepare a presentation of what you intend to do for your final project. Your presentations should be *a maximum of 10 minutes*. We will then have a few minutes afterwards reserved for discussion. A note on data: Phoebe and I will be providing suggested datasets for you to use during the week of March 12.

You should make use of at least one dataset that contains more than 250,000 rows. While there is nor necessarily any intrinsic value to 'bigness', in keeping with the spirit (and title!) of the class you will have to make sure that you come away with the ability to wrangle and visualize large datasets.

## What You Should Include

1. Topic you seek to explore using data, why you think it is important. Provide the audience with the context.
2. Present your visualization as a mock-up. It can be a series of Illustrator files; it can be hand-drawn and scanned; the idea is that you clearly show us what you plan to develop. This will be your wire frame for moving forward in the class and it will be your guide for your programming development.
3. What data you plan to use to make your visualization and how you will obtain it.
4. A timeline for the development of your visualization, what will you try to get done when. Super important to develop milestones.
5. Team responsibilities; who will be responsible for what?

## Up Next...

+ [Pin-Up materials](./02_pin-up.md) should be submitted to Stellar by *Monday May 14th by 9AM*.
