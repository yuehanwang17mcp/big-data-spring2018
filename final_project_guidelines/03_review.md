# Final Project: Final Review

## Deadlines

+ Final Review Materials should be submitted to Stellar by *May 22 by 11:59PM*.

## Description

Final reviews will take place on May 23. We will be welcoming several invited reviewers who will bring a variety of perspectives to bear on your work. You should make a presentation that does not exceed 10 minutes - we will be keeping a very careful eye on the time in this case. When preparing your presentation, you should make sure that you address the following points, as these are how your work will be evaluated, both by reviewers and by Phoebe and I as we assign grades to projects.

## How You Will Be Evaluated

1. Question introduced and clearly stated.
2. Explain the importance of their question and visualization - why does this work matter?
3. References and inspirations shown

5. Discussion of problems encountered or difference approaches that could have been developed
6. Discussion of possible future work based on initial question
7. Visuals cohere with style guide
