# Final Project: 'Pin-Up'

## Deadlines

+ Pin-Up materials should be submitted to Stellar by *Monday May 14th by 9AM*.

## Description

In the week of May 14, you will be expected to informally present your work to Eric and Phoebe. This is intended to be a final check-in in which any remaining issues are raised and met with a plan for addressing them in the following week. While Eric and Phoebe are moving around the room discussing projects with students, others will be expected to be working actively on their projects.

## What You Should Include

1. A pitch: what're you showing, why does it matter, etc. - we want to make sure you can clearly communicate your project's importance.
3. Issues with your visualization - you should be able to point clearly to what you think is the source of the problem.

## Up Next...

+ [Final Review materials](./03_review.md) should be submitted to Stellar by *Tuesday May 22 at 11:59PM*.
